## Getting Started

Use these scripts to run the Alchemy API from python. The file **alchemy_query.py** is an executable that will parse specified urls and return text files containing keywords found by using Alchemy.

**Note:** The file _**alchemy_api_key.txt**_ is not included in the Atipica master repository. Please reach out to any of the team members to get the API key.
<!--     % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].
