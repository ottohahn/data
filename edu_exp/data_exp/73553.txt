OBJECTIVE
Full-time As an international graduate student, I spare no effort to push myself in 
study and also strive to be actively involved in an environment that requires 
teamwork. Being an engineer is considered a life-long goal of mine. This goal
 will hopefully lead me to fulfillment and satisfaction. In pursuit of this, I 
believe that working in your company is the perfect way to make the dream 
come true.
