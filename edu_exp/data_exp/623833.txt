   Summary


GILD SOURCE DEVELOPER ANALYSIS

Olivier Yiptong is a high caliber C++ expert. Olivier Yiptong is a hump day hero who seems to work best in the mid-afternoon.

Olivier Yiptong's behavior is quite similar to Cheng Zhao's. It would also be impossible to look at Olivier Yiptong's activity stream and not compare it to those of

Daniel Saul, Justin Clayden (Justy), Brule Herman and Vincent Rabaud.

It seemsfrom their activity streams that Ed Lee and Olivier Yiptong are probably friends or at least virtual friends.There is also an obvious connection between

Olivier Yiptong and and Seomoz.   Employment History
