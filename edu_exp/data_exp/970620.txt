1 person has recommended Trevor

  "Trevor is the best type of person to work with. He is extremely nice and knows so much that he is

  more than willing to teach you as well. If you have an issue, he is willing to put what he is working
  on aside for a while to help you figure out exactly what the problem is and the best way to fix it. He
  is not one for the easy fix. He wants to do things right the first time, to create easily maintainable

  code. I loved working under him. It was an amazing experience."
