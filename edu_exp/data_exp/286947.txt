PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW

With my career spent operating from both Silicon Valley and Toronto, I have played key roles 
in launching companies in international markets as well as building sales’, marketing, business 
development and M&A capabilities at both publicly traded and privately held organizations. 
Operational experience at both Fortune 500 companies and smaller, leading edge technology 
organizations has given me a well-rounded skill set. The culmination of these experiences led 
me to spend the past four years immersed in co-founding & leading JOLT, a seed VC fund and 
technology accelerator in Canada. I have played both a leadership and advisory role to over 
100+ emerging tech companies, overseeing their growth in Canada and international markets.

Practice at MaRS Discovery District.
