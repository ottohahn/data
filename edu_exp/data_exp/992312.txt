Andrew Dirksen

Greater Los Angeles Area
Software Engineer at Scientific Revenue



Summary

I am currently a graduate student attending the University of Southern California. In December, I
 will be finishing my Masters in Computer Science, and I am looking for a position as a software

 engineer. For me, computer science is a way of life and not just the classes that I take. I spend
 my free time working on independent programming projects. Looking for an excuse to preorder the
 original iPad, I saw that I could combine two of my interests: playing board games and programming.

 I wrote an application that can emulate almost any board game, and lets you play them over email or
 face-to-face. When my family gets together for the holidays, the projects dont stop; last December

 we started work on Math Mutiny, which is a program designed to help kids solidify mental math skills.
 From these (and other) projects, Ive acquired skills beyond those taught in normal CS classes, like
 iOS Development, version control for remote collaboration, and working with non-programmers to

 make sure that the software matches their expectations and needs.
