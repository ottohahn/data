Experience

Research Associate at Yale University
July 2014 - Present (1 year 6 months)

  Doing research under Yale Electrical Engineering Professor Mark Reed. Started off working on
   developing FET-based biosensors, and then switched projects. Currently studying divalent ion

   transport through voltage-gated nano-channels. This project has practical applications in medicine
   as well as energy storage.

Research Associate at Stanford University

September 2013 - September 2014 (1 year 1 month)
  Worked remotely from Yale under Bioinformatics Professor Nigam Shah, analyzing Stanford

   Hospital patient data in order to evaluate health care quality. SQL was used for a majority of the
   analysis.

Research And Development Intern at Philips Lumileds

May 2014 - July 2014 (3 months)
  Worked on the development and characterization of LED materials. Techniques used include
   Wyko, Hot-Cold wafer probing, Ni-Dot, TEM, SEM, Light microscopy, Laser measurements,

   MOCVD, and Wafer processing. Optimized the Laser characterization measurement technique
   by writing and executing a LabView program to take optical laser measurements, and analyzed

   the data using Excel. Findings were presented to senior engineers, and recommendations were
   implemented in future projects.

Software Developer and Research Associate at Stanford University

May 2013 - September 2013 (5 months)
  Helped develop radiology clinical decision support software under Bioinformatics Professor Daniel

   Rubin. Program was written in Java.

Research Assistant at Stanford University
March 2010 - March 2012 (2 years 1 month)

  Helped to develop new battery materials under Stanford Materials Science Professor Yi Cui.
   Graduate student mentor founded the company Alveo Energy using the technology developed.
   Coauthored 3 publications under Prof. Cui.


Research Assistant at Stanford University
June 2011 - October 2011 (5 months)  Worked under Professor Matthew Porteus on developing a gene therapy-based cure for Sickle-Cell
   Disease, through the Stanford Institutes for Medical Research (SIMR) program. Techniques used

   include PCR, SEM, Western blot, Gel electrophoresis, and others. Work was presented at a poster
   session held at Stanford.
