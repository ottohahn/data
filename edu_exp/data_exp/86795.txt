PROJECTS
Winning Percentage of Chess Openings
- Collected over 200,000 games from FICS Games Database and parsed from chess game file type (PGN) into usable JSON file with Python; Selected 1,000 games for implementation
- Visualized the winning percentage of popular move sequences using a responsive sunburst with D3.js and simulated the moves with a chessboard.js for UI and chess.js for chess move generation/validation
- Demo: loistava.github.io/WinningPercentagesOfChessOpenings 

Voronoi Map of Ithaca Bus Stop
- Built a web application to find the nearest bus stop in Ithaca, using D3.js and Leaflet.js to partition the map into regions based on nearest neighbor search
- Extracted data of bus schedules and stop locations from TCAT bus website with Python scripts and pulled nearest restaurant data using Yelp API for each bus stop
- Developed user-friendly web interface for both desktop and mobile with Bootstrap
- Demo: tcatbus.github.io

Stock Price Forecasting
- Predicted the direction of daily stock price changes with Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on S&P 500 index from 2002 to 2014 (around 3000 entries), using tools like SVMLight, SPSS and Scikit-learn
- Reduced computation complexity by applying feature selection with Genetic Algorithm
- Implemented Ensemble Algorithm to combine multiple classifiers including Artificial Neural Network and k-Nearest Neighbors strategically and improved test accuracy to 80.94%
