Bill Zielinski

Greater Chicago Area

Technical Lead, Web Applications and SDKs at Gogo


Summary

I help companies create and deliver great products and customer experiences by developing

 the software, teams, tools and processes needed to do so. Often drawn toward innovative
 projects that havent been done before, or that cant be done, I thrive on continuously acquiring,

 learning and applying new technologies, ideas, languages and systems, as well as incorporating
 elements of design, simplicity, creativity and fun. Not one to shy away from deep-dive technical
 challenges (e.g. real time data acquisition at thousands of samples per second, wireless and network

 communications, 3D graphics and animation, physics simulations, n-dimensional data visualization,
 multi-threading and multi-processor optimization, etc.), I do what's needed to achieve the best

 possible product and experience. + Have created products for a variety of platforms: handheld
 devices, tablets, desktops, web browsers, game consoles, arcade game systems, and theme park

 attractions. + Experience with a variety of environments: startups, small, mid-sized and fortune
 100 companies. My last several projects have focused my recent attention on the current rapid
 innovation occurring in the world of sophisticated browser-based applications and large scale, object

 oriented JavaScript development.
