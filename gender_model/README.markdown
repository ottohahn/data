# genderPredictor #
GenderPredictor is a wrapper around [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)'s [Naive Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) classifier for predicting the gender given a name.

This problem is common when dealing with incomplete contact information for users.

Currently it appears to be about 82% accurate on American names but this is just the framework.
The name files are from the [US Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) and are likely in the public domain. The processed files are distributed under the same rules as the original data (which is likely public domain...).

The code is under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.
